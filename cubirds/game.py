class Game:
    '''A class representing a game of Cubirds.

    Attributes:
        n_players (int): The number of players in the game.
        current_turn (int): The current turn number. Starts at 0 and increments
                            once every player has played.
        current_player (int): The player whose turn it is.
        current_phase (str): 'lay' or 'flock'. The current phase of the player's
                             turn.
        n_rows (int): The number of rows on the board. Defaults to 4.

        deck (Stack): Cards remaining in the deck.
        discard (Stack): Discard pile.
        hands (dict of Stacks): dict with player numbers as keys and player
                                hands as values.
        collections (dict of Stacks): dict with player numbers as keys and
                                      player collections as values.
        board (dict of lists of strings): rows on the board. Represented as
                                          lists because their order matters.

        end (bool): Whether the game has ended or not.
        winner (int): if end, can be int to signify the winner or None if the
                      game ended in a draw.
